  Climate change is a real issue that is only recently becoming as serious
  as it always should have been. The effects are visible and will only get
  worse easily leading to catastrophic events like natural disasters, famine,
  drought and flooding, and complete eradication of a significant portion of species.
  <br><br>
  Through education, innovation and adherence to climate commitments we can protect
  our planet. These changes can allow for advances to infrastructure in cities across
  the globe and provide millions of new jobs and unprecedented global cooperation.
`;

const targetsContent = `
  There are 5 targets that we are aiming to meet to meet the aims of Goal 1. These are:<br>
